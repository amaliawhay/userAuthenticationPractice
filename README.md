# userAuthenticationPractice
This is a practice work space to guide me through a passport.js, Node &amp; Express user authentication tutorial. I will be following this (FreeCodeCamp)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-sFp_AvHc8] tutorial as a guide.

### Example

### Motivation
 
 I want to learn how to make a secure user login with user authentication using technologies that I am already familiar with.
